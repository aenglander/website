# Report an Issue

If you encounter an unexpected issue when using our libraries, you should report
it on the GitHub Issues tab. For example, Flask's is here:
<https://github.com/pallets/flask/issues/>.

If you have questions about your own code or how to use the libraries, read
[how to ask questions](questions.md). Don't use the issue tracker to ask
questions.

Before reporting an issue, try to determine if it has already been reported or
fixed. Search existing issues and PRs, including closed issues and merged PRs.
Search for similar phrases, code, and errors. Check that you're using the latest
release.

You don't need to report typos in documentation, unless you're unsure. Instead,
submitting a PR would probably be faster. This is _only_ the case for typos, for
everything else open an issue.

Click the green "New issue" button at the top right to start. Include the
following information in your post:

-   Write a short, descriptive title.
    -   Do not include prefixes such as "\[bug]" or "\[docs]"; maintainers will
        apply real tags as needed.
    -   Do not include a version number in the title.
-   Describe what you expected to happen.
-   Include a [minimal reproducible example] to help us identify the issue. This
    also helps check that the issue is not with your own code.
-   Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there was an
    exception.
-   List the version of Python and the project you're using. Check if this issue
    is already fixed in the latest release, or in `stable` or `main`.
